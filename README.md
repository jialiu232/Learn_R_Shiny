# Learn R Shiny

11/11/2021

Learning Shiny is one of my **TODOs** for 2021. It's almost the end of the year now, not much time left for me! I've been coding with Python and Shell a lot recently, it's time to refresh my R knowledge a little bit. With so many good reasons (plus Shiny seems to be a really wonderful tool), I plan to finally start the learning journey!

Hadley, a person that seems to be good at everything in R, wrote a book about [Rshiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/). I plan to start from there. In the next ten days, I will go through 2 chapters everyday after work. Let's do it!
